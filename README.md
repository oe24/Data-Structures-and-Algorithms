# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Code in the main branch is applied from the help of various sources.

Code in the folder is from exercising Jay Wengrow's book: A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills 2nd Edition



These are all the data structures and algorithms problems I exercised in college. I decided to add these exercises to my github account as part of a "Starting Portfolio" instead of having an empty portfolio, I know it's not much, I'll consider removing them in the future when I build some real application(s).
